# TikTok_ECOM

Okay. Here is the goal of this project. Work with a 3rd Party API in TikTok's API and build an application that allows you to query through large amounts of data 
Eseentially millions of tikToks and query for the grossing ones. If we can then display this on a screen within React JS. that would be amazing. We are not going to focus on User Login or anything like that just yhet till we pull in TikTok Data. 

To be clear a successfull project will look like the following
React JS front end , Flask Backend, Hosted in AWS with proper scaling with a SQL DB. 

Features: User can land on a web page and filter through grossing tiktoks depending on at least 4 different ways to search.
*** this is still subjective on what that is but first lets get some data.!!!!

2 weeks from now this is complete.
